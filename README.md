# Masked Face Detection and Recognition using MobileNet

## Overview
This project focuses on masked face detection and recognition using MobileNet, a lightweight deep learning model optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications. The model is trained to identify faces with and without masks and perform accurate facial recognition.

## Features
- Detects masked and unmasked faces.
- Recognizes individuals even with a mask.
- Lightweight and optimized for real-time performance using MobileNet.
- Can be integrated into surveillance systems, access control, and healthcare applications.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for scripting and model implementation)
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (for deep learning)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **MobileNet** (for efficient face detection and recognition)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data handling)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizing results)

## Dataset
The model is trained on a combination of publicly available datasets containing images of masked and unmasked faces. Data augmentation techniques were applied to improve generalization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and necessary dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib
